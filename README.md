# pomodoro

A project completed as part of my Thinkful curriculum. This is a timer which alternates between study periods and break periods built in React.

## tools used:

- React (with functional components and hooks)
- JavaScript

## prompt:

The Pomodoro technique is a time-management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. For this project, you will implement a simplified version of Cirillo's original Pomodoro technique.

## learning objectives:

- Installing packages via NPM
- Running tests from the command line
- Writing React function components
- Using hooks like useState()
- Debugging React code through console output

## takeaways:

- It was fun to create a dynamic timer that includes changing what is rendered based on state.
- This is the first time I've used sounds in an application I've built.
- There was a suggested challenge in this project to keep all state in a single object. This proved to be a nice way to keep it organized and made props much less messy to keep track of.
